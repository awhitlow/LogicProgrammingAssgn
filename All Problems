%PROBLEM 1
% If the list is empty, the sum should be zero and the result will be true
sum-up-numbers-simple([], 0).

% If the list is not empty
sum-up-numbers-simple([Value | Remainder], Sum) :-
  % Check that the first value is a number
	number(Value),
  % Call the predicate again with the remainder of the list and the result of adding the previous values together
	sum-up-numbers-simple(Remainder, Result),
	Sum is Value + Result.
	
%If the list is not empty 
sum-up-numbers-simple([Value | Remainder], Result) :-
	% If the value encountered is not a number
	\+(number(Value)),
	% Call the predicate again with the remainder and result, with the result simply
	% equaling the previous result and not a newly calculated one
sum-up-numbers-simple(Remainder, Result).

%PROBLEM 2
%If the list is empty, the sum is 0
sum-up-numbers-general([], 0).

%If the value in the list is a number 
sum-up-numbers-general([Value | Remainder], Sum) :-
	number(Value),
  %Call the predicate again with the remainder of the list and sum of previous values as the arguments
	sum-up-numbers-general(Remainder, Result),
  %Definition of sum is the first value plus the result
	Sum is Value + Result.
	
%If the value in the list is not a number
sum-up-numbers-general([Value | Remainder],Result) :-
	\+(number(Value)),
	%Call the predicate recursively with the remainder of the list and the result 
	%which is equal to the previous result
	sum-up-numbers-general(Remainder,Result).
	
%If the value in the list is a list
sum-up-numbers-general([Value | Remainder], Result) :-
	%Check if the head of the list is a list
	is_list(Value),
	%Recursively call the function with the head of the list and the previous result
sum-up-numbers-general(Value,Result).

%PROBLEM 3
%Predicate to find the smallest value in L1 larger than the minimum in L2
min-above-min(L1, L2, Result) :-
  %Find the minimum of L2 by calling the findMin predicate
  findMin(L2, L2Min), 
  %True if LargerL1 is a list that contains all values of L1 that are larger than the minimum of L2
  include(findLarger(L2Min), L1, LargerL1), 
  %Find the minimum of the list of values larger than the minimum of L2
  findMin(LargerL1, Result).

%Compare which values are larger than the other
findLarger(Val, Result) :- Result > Val. 

%Predicate to find the minimum of a list 
%If there is only one value in the list, it is the minimum
findMin([Head], Head).
%The head is the minimum of the list if it is less than the value that is found when the 
%remainder of the list and minimum are used as arguments
findMin([Head|Remainder], Head) :- 
    findMin(Remainder, Minimum), Head < Minimum.
%The calculated minimum is the minimum of the list if the head of the list is greater than the minimum value
findMin([Head|Remainder], Minimum) :- 
findMin(Remainder, Minimum), Head >= Minimum.

member(N, L2).
